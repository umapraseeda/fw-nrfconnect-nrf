TLS and certificate generation
##############################

`Transport Layer Security (TLS)`_ is a protocol that is used for secure communication between a client and a server in a TCP connection.
TLS provides the mechanisms to encrypt the data that is sent and to verify the identity of both the client and the server using digital certificates that are called TLS certificates.
This guide provides an introduction to TLS and focuses on the requirements and options on the client side in a TCP connection.
